This file calculates the VIF for each variable. Please note that this is computationally VERY VERY expensive (may take a very very long time to run). I could not run this myself since each regression takes over a minute to run which would total to about 30+ hours given the number of variables and regressions that will occur with the variables.

#Libraries
```{r}

# Calculating VIF for each variable.
```{r}
data = read_csv("data/imputed_data.csv")
```

```{r}
vif_values = c()

variables = names(data)

fit <- lapply(data[,names(data)], function(x) lm(x ~ ., data = data))

for(item in fit){
  rsq = summary(item)$r.squared
  vif = 1/(1-rsq)
  vif_values.append(vif)
}

```

```{r}
vif_df = data.frame(variables, vif_values)
```
